# CSE143-Fall2021-Assessment1-LetterInventory
Take-home Assessment 1: Letter Inventory

# Overview
In this assessment, you will implement a class called LetterInventory that can be used to keep track of an inventory of letters of the English alphabet. The constructor for the class will take a String as a parameter and compute how many of each letter are in that String (i.e. how many as, how many bs, etc.). LetterInventory ignores any character that is not an English letter (such as punctuation or digits) and treats upper- and lowercase letters as the same.
